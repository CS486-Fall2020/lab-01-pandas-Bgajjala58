# Lab-01-Pandas

## ATP World Rankings

This collection has been scrapped from the ATP Tour Website. It consists of tennis player (current and former) and statistical parameters on world no.1 over the last two decades which gives room to draw meaningful insights.

In this lab, your task is to understand the dataset and determine the best player over the last two decades. You are expected to use techniques in pandas to manipulate the dataset, visualize it and reach a conclusion. (Note: There is no expected answer and we would like to understand your perspective while looking at the dataset.)

### Dataset is available on Canvas: [Access Here](ATP_World_Rankings.csv)
